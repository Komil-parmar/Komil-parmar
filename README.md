## Detailed Journey:

Hello! I’m Komil Parmar, an 19-year-old machine-learning enthusiast from Vadodara, Gujarat. My journey in computer science began in class 8, where I got into 3D modeling at first, switched to Ethical hacking in class 9, and finally found my passion in machine learning in class 10. That year, I completed my first course in AI alongside my school and then completed 2 more in ML during that vacation by the end of which I also cleared the TensorFlow Developer Certification Exam. Despite the academic interruptions during high school, I remained committed to my interests.
***
Studying machine learning alongside my high school studies was challenging. By the end of class 12, I was so frustrated having to learn unrelated subjects not just out of curiosity but to the extent of clearing JEE (which is known to be one of the toughest exams) that I was eagerly waiting for the vacations so that I can continue my journey of self-learning. But as soon as the vacations arrived, I was again stuck with exams like JEE, JEE Advance, and then college selection. I researched the curriculums and syllabuses of colleges that were providing a Bachelor's degree in ML and I never thought college selection would be that disappointing. Though I'm not a professional and might not be aware of even some of the most common concepts in ML, I'm confident I'll catch up faster at home than most college students in India, because there (at college), I'd again have to study unrelated subjects like Chemistry, Biology, Graphics, Animations, Physics, Circuits, workshops and what not, just for getting a piece of paper with a precious stamp on it. Hence, I decided to skip the traditional way of learning.
***
Although the decision was very straightforward, skipping traditional offline college is still the hardest decision I have ever made so far since it is not just about studies, but also about having the experience, meeting people, making friends, etc. I hope I will somehow miraculously get in touch with people who can help me compensate for these sacrifices. Hence, I am not only eager to connect with like-minded individuals and make new friends but In fact, I would be very much grateful to those who can connect with me, whether as a friend or a mentor. Let’s learn and grow together!
